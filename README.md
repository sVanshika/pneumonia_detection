# Pneumonia Detection using Convulational Neural Network

The images trained, tested and validated for the neural network are chest X-Ray images. The implementation of clinical-decision support algorithms for medical imaging faces challenges with reliability and interpretability. 
Here, I establish a diagnostic tool based on a deep-learning framework for the screening of patients with common treatable blinding retinal diseases.
